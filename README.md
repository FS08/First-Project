# First-Project

My first Python code to calculate pay per month.
  
  After following the first lessons of freeCodeCamp i was able to create my first project, where i calculate the pay per month, 
  knowing how many hours someone in a week, how much they are paid per hour, then * the number of weeks worked in a month to give the total at the end.
  It's a simple project but im very happy after one month of learning programming that i was able to create my first project.
